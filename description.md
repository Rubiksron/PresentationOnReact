My presentation will show students how to customize styling on a radio button.  This is not as easy as one might think, there is some misdirection used and hiding of elements to complete the illusion of styling a radio button because one cannot style a radio button directly.  Customized radio buttons is a great way to show creativity, and if a customer sees that extra time and effort was put in to the user experience, they would feel confident that 
the same time and effort was spent making the product.  Learn how to customize radio buttons with pure CSS to make your forms stand out.
